# Idealcodes

**Idealcodes** is a two years [Digiteo](http://www.digiteo.fr/)
research project, started in October 2014. The partners involved are
[√âcole Polytechnique](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) (X) and
[Universit√© de Versailles ‚Äì Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines](http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/)
(UVSQ). It funds one post-doc, working at the boundary between coding
theory, cryptography and computer algebra.

## Abstract

**Idealcodes** spans the three research areas of algebraic coding
theory, cryptography, and computer algebra, by investigating the
problem of lattice reduction (and root-finding).  In algebraic coding
theory this is found in Guruswami and Sudan's list decoding of
algebraic geometry codes and Reed--Solomon codes.  In cryptography, it
is found in Coppersmith's method for finding small roots of integer
equations. These topics were unified and generalised by
[Cohn and Heninger](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1284), by considering
algebraic geometry codes and number field codes under the deep analogy
between polynomials and integers.
[Sophisticated results in coding theory](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1530722&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1530722)
could be then
[carried over to cryptanalysis](http://msp.org/obs/2013/1/p14.xhtml),
and [vice-versa](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1284).  The generalized
view raises problems of computing efficiently, which is one of the
main research topics of **Idealcodes**.
